  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{debianize()}: the generated copyright file now has https instead of http
        in the format URL
      \item \code{debianizeKeyring()}: no longer use ASCII armored key files but binary only
      \item \code{debianizeKeyring()}: dropped deprecated support for
        /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/, also "apt-key add" is no longer used. keys are just copied to
        /usr/share/keyrings/ and therefore *must* be pinned explicitly for the reposiory
        via "[signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/...]". this is the more secure approach,
        but wasn't supported before 2017
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: if roxyPackage was in sandbox mode, there were issues
        finding the RSS image
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: new action \code{"buildEmAll"} to trigger builds for multiple
        versions of R (if more than one was provided also)
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: new action \code{"gitCheckout"} to switch to a tagged release
        for binary rebuilds, works well in sandbox mode
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: HTML page for debain package installation now explains
        how to break the circle and successfully install the keyring package if apt
        refuses to install it because the keyring package wasn't installed yet
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: HTML page now links to ORCID if a valid ID is provided as
        a person's comment named \code{"ORCID"}; it will ask you to call
        \code{orcid_icon_fetcher()} as well, to fetch the correct icon file
      \item \code{orcid_icon_fetcher()}: small helper function to download the ORCID SVG
        icon into your repository should you need one
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: if pandoc is available, README.md and NEWS.md will be
        compiled into HTML versions and linked in a package's index page unser
        \code{"Materials"}
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: new argument \code{"R.libs.append"} to add R libraries that are
        by default included during package builds
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: adjusted ordering of enties in repo HTML page similar to
        CRAN (contributed by robert nuske)
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: HTML pages for debian repositories now suggest to include
        "signed-by" in the lists files
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: the generated README.md now suggests
        "\code{devtools::install_github()}" instead of loading the package first
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: \code{"cleanRd"} no longer throws a warning for each file
        changed, but one summary warning listing all affected files
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: the ChangeLog was moved to \code{"Materials"} on a package's
        index page, next to README.html and NEWS.html
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: if R >= 4.0 is detected, the default directory for debian
        package files will be set to \code{"debR40"} instead of \code{"deb"}
      \item removed deprecated internal functions \code{deb.gen.prerm()} and
        \code{deb.gen.postinst()}
      \item \code{debianizeKeyring()}: you can now define multiple OpenPGP keys to sign the
        Release files, which can be used to seamlessly replace a soon expired key
    }
  }

\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.06-4 (2018-07-29)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: explicitly set the R library for multiple R builds
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{debianize()}: new argument \code{"deb.dir"} to use a custom debian main directory
        for the package repository, mainly to make it possible to have separate
        repos for incompatible R versions
      \item \code{debianize()}: now tries to add proper r-api-* package dependencies if R >=
        3.2 is detected
      \item \code{debianizeKeyring()} also gained the new \code{"deb.dir"} argument
      \item \code{sandbox()}: new argument \code{"clean"} to wipe an existing sandbox before
        setting up a new vanilla one
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: if R >= 3.5 is detected, the default directory for debian
        package files will be set to \code{"debR35"} instead of \code{"deb"}
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: added \code{"buildVignettes"} to the actions only performed only
        during first run if building for multiple R versions
      \item \code{archive.packages()}: \code{"deb.dir"} must now also be set explicitly in the
        \code{"deb.options"}
      \item \code{roxy.description()}: updated internal function responsible for setting up
        the *-package.R file to use more macros (\\packageTitle\{\},
        \\packageDescription\{\}, \\packageAuthor\{\}, and \\packageMaintainer\{\}); didn't yet get
        \\packageDESCRIPTION\{\} or \\packageIndices\{\} to generate useful info, so that's
        still done the old way

\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.06-3 (2018-05-07)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: fixed a HTML issue introduced with the html.options
        \code{"imprint"} and \code{"privacy.policy"}
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.06-2 (2018-05-06)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: use "el-capitan" as the default symlink for macOS repos
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: unset some environment variables that might cause trouble
        if building for multiple R versions
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: new html.options \code{"imprint"} and \code{"privacy.policy"} to add
        links to respective pages from your repo
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.06-1 (2018-03-08)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{debianize()}: worked around a bug in \code{utils::tar()} rendering it almost
        useless
      \item fixed a really dumb bug in \code{archive.packages()} setting the PGP key to 2 by
        default for \code{"deb"} archives
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the package now needs at least R >= 3.0.0, all code fragments which tried
        to keep supporting R 2.14 and even earlier were removed. no-one should
        use that any longer
      \item the arguments 'html.index' and 'html.title' were moved to 'index' and
        'title' of a new option list called 'html.options' for more consistency; old
        code should still work for the time being, but trigger a warning -- please
        update your scripts!
      \item cleaned up dependencies, now using mostly imports instead
      \item set debhelper default dependency to >> 9.0.0 (instead of >> 7.0.0)
      \item worked around the news2Rd issue by copying the function to the internal
        namespace
      \item there's also no longer a need to call private functions from the XiMpLe
        package
      \item replaced private function \code{last.dir.name()} with base function \code{basename()}
      \item repo: changed the way symlinks are set for macOS; we're now creating the
        top level directory and link to ../contrib, to work around issues with
        infinite link loops; this does not affect existing repos, only new ones
      \item since Flattr totally changed its API and stuff, the Flattr integration
        was updated. no more buttons will be generated, instead a meta tag is added
        to HTML and/or markdown documents. this also means you need to remove the
        'flattrUser' value from 'readme.options' and add your meta tag ID to the
        new 'html.options' for this to work correctly
      \item vignette is now in RMarkdown/HTML format; the SWeave/PDF version was
        dropped
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{rnw2rmd()}: new function that tries to convert Sweave vignettes into R
        markdown
      \item \code{package_description()}: new function to make it easier to generate proper
        package description objects (prevent typos, demand mandatory fields, value
        checks)
      \item \code{debianize()}: explain in the docs that setting a package in
        \code{"depends.origin.alt"} to NULL will enable you to provide the full R debian package name
      \item \code{roxy.html()}: URLs in the form of "(... <...>)" are now automatically
        turned into <a href> nodes; i hope the parser doesn't introduce new issues
      \item \code{roxy.html()}: fields \code{"Additional_repositories"} and \code{"NeedsCompilation"} are
        now also evaluated
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: vignette generation now takes an existing .install_extras
        file into account when moving/copying files
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: new action \code{"vignette"} can be used to generate an initial
        vignette stub file
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: new action \code{"buildVignettes"} forces rebuilding all
        vignettes during the \code{"package"} action, to make sure a proper vignette index is
        present in the source tarball; this was made configurable via its own action
        because it is a bit time consuming during builds and usually only
        neccessary for actual releases
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.05-3 (2017-06-09)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{debianize()}: the \code{"append"} feature for dependencies in was broken
      \item \code{archive.packages()} now defaults to gpg2 as well
      \item \code{debianize()}: the HTML instructions look pretty again, worked around a
        layout problem caused by XiMpLe's auto-indentation in <pre> tags
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: internal use of \code{tools::getVignetteInfo()} was unaware of
        custom R libs.
      \item added robert nuske as an official contributor to the package
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item R versions older that 3.0 should no longer be around (it was released
        four years ago). support for these older versions will be removed in one of
        the future releases. for now, a warning is shown, announcing that use with
        R <3.0 is deprecated
      \item \code{debianize()}: the R version used for build dependencies in \code{"control"} is
        now taken from DESCRIPTION by default, not the current version
      \item \code{debianize()}: the package description in \code{"control"} is now similar to
        CRAN2deb
      \item cleaned up all tests, using two new/revised internal functions
        \code{roxyPackage:::generateTestPackage()} and \code{roxyPackage:::removeTestPackage()}
      \item updated vignette to include \code{templateFile()}
      \item \code{roxy.html()}: HTML page now lists all contributors indicating their roles
        (contributed by robert nuske)
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: checks should be done on built packages, the \code{"check"}
        action now throws a warning if checks are done on unpackaged sources (which is
        the case if you omit the \code{"package"} action)
      \item \code{roxy.html()}: we're now also including the comments of person objects
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: the README.md file generated by the \code{"readme"} action now
        flags the installation code as R syntax
      \item \code{debianize()}: bumped default compat level from 7 to 9 and added \code{"compat"}
        to the files that are updated by default
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item new function \code{templateFile()} to quickly generate new source file templates
        for functions, S4 classes and methods, including some hopefully useful
        defaults (copyright, roxygen documentation and code stubs)
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: the \code{"URL"} option can now also be a named list to be able
        to either host the debian repo on a different server, or to configure the
        use of a \code{"mirror.list"} and a custom \code{"debian.path"}
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: the HTML instructions for debian packages now also lists
        the package source files
      \item new EXPERIMENTAL feature: there are cases where \code{roxygenize()} somehow
        fails but e.g. \code{document()} of the devtools package doesn't. you can now use
        roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name=\code{"roxyFunction"}, value=devtools::document) to
        overwrite the function that is being used to roxygenize the docs. use this
        with caution! it is experimental for a reason!
      \item \code{roxy.html()}: HTML page now also lists LinkingTo: and SystemRequirements:
        if present (contributed by robert nuske)
      \item \code{roxy.package()}: source and windows builds now also include an MD5 file
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.05-2 (2017-02-26)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item replaced some tilde characters in the vignette by \\textasciitilde
      \item debinanizing failed with certain versions of dpkg-parsechangelog
        expecting a space after "--count"
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item added \code{"readme"} action to vignette
      \item changed the docs to suggest to give the most recent R version first in
        line when building for multiple versions. the debianizing is now also done
        during the first run
      \item internal function \code{GPGsign()} now forces both cert-digest-algo and
        digest-algo to be set to SHA256; for now, this is hard coded but could be made
        configurable if requested
      \item reaktanz.de supports HTTPS now, updated references
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item internal function \code{GPGsign()} is now also capable of generating InRelease
        files; they will automatically be added to debian repos from now on
      \item HTML page now also lists Imports and BugReports, which can either be a
        URL or mail address (contributed by robert nuske)
      \item if all of 'Date', 'Packaged', and 'Date/Publication' are missing in
        DESCRIPTION, pck.date will now be used as well (contributed by robert nuske)
      \item support for vignette types other than PDF (contributed by robert nuske)
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.05-1 (2016-07-12)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item R CMD check should be performed on built packages, not source
        directories. this is now the case if you run the \code{"check"} action also with \code{"package"}
        enabled
      \item fixed a path issue causing problems to find package sources when in full
        sandboxing mode, most importantly, this affected the internal function
        \code{prep.sndbx.source.dir()}
      \item normalized paths in internal function \code{mvToArchive()}, called by
        \code{archive.packages()}
      \item using \code{tools::package_dependencies()} instead of
        \code{tools::package.dependencies()} if R >= 3.3
      \item the \code{tar()} function of R produced broken archives with files added
        multiple times
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the code for checks was moved to the end of \code{roxy.package()}
      \item removed \code{deb.gen.changelog.old()}, it was unused since 0.04-2
      \item \code{debianize()} now generates machine-readable copyright files
      \item when \code{debianizeKeyring()} is called from \code{debianize()} or \code{roxy.rackage()}, it
        is now able to fetch the repo URL
      \item removed overwrite argument from internal function \code{deb.update.release()}
        because it actually didn't have any effect anyway
      \item revert back to adding standard LICENSE files instead of LICENSE.txt, as
        none of them are accepted on CRAN anyway
      \item code cleaning (loops)
      \item removed the internal package description (obsolete)
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item new action \code{"readme"} to generate an initial README.md file
      \item new action \code{"binonly"} to enable binary-only rebuilds
      \item HTML page now lists all found binary packages for a package if it is
        available for more than one R version in the repository
      \item \code{archive.packages()} can now also archive Debian repositories; it gained
        new arguments keep.revisions and deb.options for fine-tuning
      \item if readme.options contains a Flattr user and URL is set, a Flattr button
        will also be added to the repository HTML page
      \item \code{debianize()} has a new option keep.existing.orig to prevent binary-only
        rebuilds from overwriting existing *.orig.[gz|xz] archives
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.04-4 (2016-02-04)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item re-activated the unit tests that were shut down with 0.03-11 due to
        https://github.com/hadley/testthat/issues/86 as there's now a workaround fixing
        tests/testthat.R
      \item removed leftover tests/test_roxyPackage_package.R
      \item updated URL to roxygen2 in docs
      \item fixed title case in title field
      \item fixed imports in NAMESPACE file
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item moved unit tests to tests/testthat
      \item added dch and dpkg-parsechangelog to dependecy checks of \code{debianize()}
      \item default section for debian R packages is now "gnu-r" instead of \code{"math"}
      \item \code{archive.packages()} now uses type \code{"mac.binary"} instead of the deprecated
        \code{"mac.binary.leopard"}
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item new option \code{"OSX.repo"} to deal with the constantly changing paths of
        binary repos for max OS X
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.04-3 (2015-06-29)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item internal function \code{parseChangeLog()} now checks for proper version and date
        information and throws an error if one is missing, as suggested by robert
        nuske
      \item making sure the \code{"inst"} directory exists before trying to copy a NEWS.Rd
        file there
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.04-2 (2015-03-05)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item debian packages with a dot in their names were overlooked when it came to
        generating the HTML docs
      \item somehow a wrong release date for 0.03-12 sneaked into the ChangeLog...
      \item newlines in DESCRIPTION caused \code{debianize()} to misread dependency
        information and quit with an error
      \item roxygen2 can produce too long comment lines in Rd file heads; using
        \code{"cleanRd"} on this resulted in broken Rd files because the comment char was
        missing
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item removed the options \code{"local.roxy.dir"} and \code{"roxy.unlink.target"} from
        \code{roxy.package()}, as their counterparts are no longer supported by roxygen2. if
        you still need those options (working with ancient roxygen2 versions), use
        \code{"roxygen.dir"} and \code{"unlink.target"} in \code{"..."} instead
      \item removed the workaround call to \code{roxygen2:::source_package()} as well, it
        doesn't seem to be necessary any longer
      \item \code{roxy.package()} now uses "--install-tests" as default option for "R CMD
        install"
      \item \code{debianize()} now passes \code{"build.dir"} on to \code{debianizeKeyring()} as a default
      \item \code{debianize()} now uses dch and dpkg-parsechangelog to manage
        debain/changelog, which is much more robust than the previous construction
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item a new RKWard plugin allows you to really quickly get started with your
        own roxyPackage script
      \item basic support for \code{"cph"} (copyright holder) field in author roles
    }
  }
}
\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.04-1 (2014-06-14)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{tools::buildVignettes()} doesn't produce PDFs if they are already present;
        remove present PDFs, if the \code{"doc"} action is active. the vignettes
        creation was reworked to deal with vignettes directories more smoothly, e.g.
        create inst/doc and copy results and sources there
      \item \code{debianize()} didn't auto-append default dependencies correctly
      \item docs of \code{debianize()} falsely still said that source packaging wasn't
        implemented
      \item example in \code{debianize()} showed description in lowercase, which wouldn't
        work
      \item \code{debianize()} didn't get multiple authors quite all right
      \item the copyright file generated by \code{debianize()} missed out the homepage and
        overwrite rule
      \item signature changes to \code{roxygenize()} in roxygen2 >= 4.0.0 are now implemented
      \item the logic to remove build directories for debian packages could have
        dangerous consequences if you chose them unwise; now, the directory will only
        be removed if it was empty before the build process
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{debianize()} gained the new argument \code{"repo.name"}, used for generating a
        debian package from the OpenPGP key used for secure apt. you should set this
        to something different from the default if you plan to actually publish
        the repository -- if you don't, you'll get a warning
      \item expect gpg2 as the default (earlier versions defaulted to gpg)
      \item moved code for generation of several debian package files into autonomous
        internal functions
      \item suppressed the LaTeX output, so the console messages are more
        comprehensible
      \item in the sources, moved definition of classes and methods to files with
        more speaking names
      \item removed the temporary hack to test roxygen3, since roxygen2 4.x is
        already released and runs out-of-the-box with this version of roxyPackage
      \item source packages for debian now default to xz compression
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item new function \code{debianizeKeyring()} can generate debian packages from OpenPGP
        keys

    \itemize{
      \item \code{tools::pkgVignettes()} and \code{tools::buildVignettes()} stopped working without
        an existing DESCRIPTION file. working around that by moving the calls to
        a place where the file should be present already
      \item added a workaround for roxygen2 >= 3.0.0, calling
        \code{roxygen2:::source_package()} to overcome unsolved issues with its S4 implementation

      \item managed to remove some of the \code{setwd()} calls, but some don't seem to be
        replaceable as of now. this seems to trigger the problems with the unit
        tests, so they remain deactivated in tests/ test_roxyPackage_package.R, but
        have been revived in inst/tests/test,R
      \item added a proper GPL notice at the beginning of each R file
      \item replaced all tabs in the source code by two space characters

\section{Changes in roxyPackage version 0.03-11 (2013-10-27)}{
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item another attempt to fix the \code{.find.package()} issue (see log for 0.03-5), as
        suggested by kurt hornik
      \item typo in docs to \code{debianize()} corrected (\code{"epoch"} instead of \code{"Epoch"})
      \item \code{dep4deb()} now always returns $dl as a matrix
      \item "--no-vignettes" is deprecated as of R 3.0.0, replaced with
        "--no-build-vignettes"
      \item corrected some ::: operators into ::
      \item new action \code{"cleanRd"} checks for lines longer than 90 chars in Rd files
        and adds automatic line breaks (with a warning). otherwise R CMD check would
        complain and the package wouldn't be accepted on CRAN. this is actually a
        workaround for a bug in roxygen2, regarding automatically generated usage
        sections
      \item in the generated DESCRIPTION file, authors and contributors will no
        longer be listed with their e-mail address, just plain names
      \item sandboxing and running the \code{"check"} action now also copies suggested
        packages to the sandbox folders if neccessary
    }
  }
  \subsection{removed}{
    \itemize{
      \item removed the unit tests for this release, because they suddenly stopped
        working with "R CMD check" (while still running fine from an R session).
        i.e., it's not that the tests themselves fail, but the testthat package stops
        with yet mysterious errors. i filed a report, hope this can be solved
        soon: https://github.com/hadley/testthat/issues/86
    }
  }
  \subsection{changed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the vignette was moved from inst/doc to inst/vignettes
      \item some lines in the docs were too long and have been shortened
      \item internal function \code{autoLineBreak()} returns a nameless character vector now
      \item beginning with this version, roxyPackage is no longer hosted on CRAN. its
        policies and checks have become more strict over time, and since the
        alternative would have been to reduce this package's features to remain in
        full compliance, i decided to have the package removed instead. the problem
        is this: the NEWS.Rd related features rely on calls to the internal
        function \code{tools:::news2Rd()}, as is even recommended in the manual to \code{news()}; CRAN
        doesn't allow this use of an internal functions, even if it's exactly what
        the R docs say.
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item another EXPERIMENTAL feature: call
        'roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name=\code{"Rdevel"}, value=TRUE)' and 'roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name=\code{"Rversion"},
        value=\code{"x.y.z"})' to manually set an arbitrary R version string to be able to build
        against bleeding edge R-devel installations
      \item new \code{roxy.package()} arguments \code{"Rbuildignore"} and \code{"Rinstignore"} can be used
        to control .Rbuildignore and .Rinstignore files, respectively
    }

  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{debianize()}: support for epoch in debian package versioning

        replacing the automatically found
      \item \code{debianize()}: support for arbitrary fields in \code{"deb.description"}
    }
  }
  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{
      \item the *-package.R file used to contain an alias of the package name alone,
        which would cause trouble if there's a function or similar by the same
        name/alias. now only the alias '<package name>-package' will be included.

  \subsection{fixed}{
    \itemize{

        temporarily, instead of trying to use "en_GB.UTF-8" (which is not
        available on all machines). this small function is needed for timestamps in
        Debian changelogs
      \item fixed the split-up of debinaizing actions for multiple R installations:
        the previous implementation accidently dropped package building completely
    }
  }
  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item new function \code{dep4deb()} can recursively download dependencies for a given
        package. this is still in its early stages and probably buggy, and i am
        also considering placing all Debian related functionality into a package of
        its own (which would become a dependency of roxyPackage), soon.

  \subsection{added}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{debianize()} can now try to build a valid debian package directly from
        arbitrary package sources; it will try to generate plausible dependencies
        from the R package names provided in DESCRIPTION
      \item \code{debianize()} does also try to include package \code{"Suggests"} automagically
      \item added some basic unit tests, using the testthat package

      \item \code{debianize()} now adds dependecies to r-base-core (instead of r-base) and
        debhelper >= 7.0.0 (instead of >= 4.1.0) if none are given
      \item \code{debianize()} doesn't set the maintainer of upstream as the debian package
        maintainer by default any longer, but generates a maintainer ID from
        system information and throws a warning. this should encourage everyone to set
        at least valid maintainer information manually
      \item if multiple R installations are provided, the \code{"deb"} action will be split
        up: debianizing the sources will be done during first run, but package
        building during the last

        roxygen3: call 'roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name=\code{"roxygenVersion"}, value=3)' to
        enable some hidden features, i.e. use \code{roxygen3::roxygenise()} instead of
        \code{roxygen2::roxygenize()}. you need to install and load the roxygen3 package first
        -- temper with this at your own risk. please note: there will probably
        never be an official roxygen3 package on CRAN, and once its features were
        merged into roxygen2, this option might be patched out of roxyPackage again.

        an archive directory, or to remove them for good. since this is
        potentially dangerous and needs some rounds of testing, its \code{"reallyDoIt"}-option
