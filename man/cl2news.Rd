\title{Convert ChangeLog/NEWS into NEWS.Rd}
\usage{
cl2news(log, news = NULL, codify = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{log}{Character string, path to the ChangeLog or NEWS file to be converted.}

\item{news}{Character string, path to the NEWS.Rd file to be written.
If \code{NULL}, results are written to \code{stdout()}.}

\item{codify}{Logical,
      whether to try to detect code snippets like function names and markup them accordingly.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical, whether to overwrite an existing NEWS.Rd file.}
}
\value{
No return value, writes a file.
}
\description{
This function attempts to translate ASCII ChangeLog (or NEWS) files into NEWS.Rd files.
}
\details{
This should work for ChangeLog and NEWS files that
\enumerate{
  \item have entries named "Changes in version <version number>" (and optionally a YYYY-MM-DD date string afterwards)
  \item have single changes properly itemized, by indentation and then either \code{"o"},
      \code{"-"} or \code{"*"} followed
    by space
  \item optionally have categories as subsections, like "Fixed" or "Added"
}
Any text string that isn't indented and doesn't start with "Changes in version" will likely be treated as a subsection.
The ChangeLog related functions and methods of this package,
      e.g. \code{\link[roxyPackage:initChangeLog]{initChangeLog}}, are
a convenient way to maintain R ChangeLogs in a proper format.

This function is basically a wrapper for the internal function \code{tools:::news2Rd}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
cl2news(log="~/myFiles/myRPackage/ChangeLog", news="~/myFiles/myRPackage/inst/NEWS.Rd")

# use capture.output() to dump the results into a character vector
NEWS.object <- capture.output(cl2news(log="~/myFiles/myRPackage/ChangeLog"))
}
