# roxyPackage

roxyPackage is a collection of tools to automate packaging of [R](https://r-project.org) code.

The intention of this package is to make packaging R code as easy as possible. 'roxyPackage' uses
tools from the 'roxygen2' package to generate documentation. It also automatically generates and
updates files like *-package.R, DESCRIPTION, CITATION, ChangeLog and NEWS.Rd. Building packages
supports source format, as well as several binary formats (MS Windows, Mac OS X, Debian GNU/Linux)
if the package contains pure R code only.

The packages built are stored in a fully functional local R package repository which can be synced to a
web server to share them with others. This includes the generation of browsable HTML pages similar to
CRAN, with support for RSS feeds from the ChangeLog. Please read the vignette for a more detailed
explanation by example.

roxyPackage also includes a plugin for [RKWard](https://rkward.kde.org), a powerful GUI and
IDE for R, providing graphical dialogs for its basic features. To make full use of this feature,
please install [RKWard](https://rkward.kde.org) (plugins are detected automatically).

More information on roxyPackage is available on the [project homepage](https://reaktanz.de/?c=hacking&s=roxyPackage).

## Installation

### Development releases via the project repository

Installation of tha latest stable release is fairly easy, it's available from the project's own repository:

```r
install.packages("roxyPackage", repo=c(getOption("repos"), reaktanz="https://reaktanz.de/R"))
```

To automatically get updates, consider adding the repository to your R configuration. You might also
want to subscribe to the package's [RSS feed](https://reaktanz.de/R/pckg/roxyPackage/RSS.xml) to get notified of new releases.

If you're running a Debian based operating system, you might be interested in the
[precompiled *.deb packages](https://reaktanz.de/R/pckg/roxyPackage/deb_repo.html).

### Installation via GitHub

To install it directly from GitHub, you can use `install_github()` from the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("unDocUMeantIt/roxyPackage") # stable release
install_github("unDocUMeantIt/roxyPackage", ref="develop") # development release
```

### Not on CRAN

Unfortunately, one feature of roxyPackage, namely the generation of a NEWS.Rd file, violates the CRAN policy
because it uses an internal function of the R utils package. Since this is the officially recommended way
of making NEWS.Rd files, there's no obvious workaround for this, hence roxyPackage is not available on CRAN
any longer.
