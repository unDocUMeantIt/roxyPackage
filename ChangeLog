ChangeLog for package roxyPackage

changes in version 0.04-4 (2015-09-29)
unreleased:
  - this release is under development
fixed:
  - re-activated the unit tests that were shut down with 0.03-11 due to
    https://github.com/hadley/testthat/issues/86 as there's now a workaround
    fixing tests/testthat.R
  - removed leftover tests/test_roxyPackage_package.R
  - updated URL to roxygen2 in docs
  - fixed title case in title field
  - fixed imports in NAMESPACE file
changed:
  - moved unit tests to tests/testthat
  - added dch and dpkg-parsechangelog to dependecy checks of debianize()

changes in version 0.04-3 (2015-06-29)
fixed:
  - internal function parseChangeLog() now checks for proper version and date
    information and throws an error if one is missing, as suggested by robert
    nuske
  - making sure the "inst" directory exists before trying to copy a NEWS.Rd
    file there

changes in version 0.04-2 (2015-03-05)
fixed:
  - debian packages with a dot in their names were overlooked when it came to
    generating the HTML docs
  - somehow a wrong release date for 0.03-12 sneaked into the ChangeLog...
  - newlines in DESCRIPTION caused debianize() to misread dependency
    information and quit with an error
  - roxygen2 can produce too long comment lines in Rd file heads; using
    "cleanRd" on this resulted in broken Rd files because the comment char was
    missing
changed:
  - removed the options "local.roxy.dir" and "roxy.unlink.target" from
    roxy.package(), as their counterparts are no longer supported by roxygen2. if
    you still need those options (working with ancient roxygen2 versions), use
    "roxygen.dir" and "unlink.target" in "..." instead
  - removed the workaround call to roxygen2:::source_package() as well, it
    doesn't seem to be necessary any longer
  - roxy.package() now uses "--install-tests" as default option for "R CMD
    install"
  - debianize() now passes "build.dir" on to debianizeKeyring() as a default
  - debianize() now uses dch and dpkg-parsechangelog to manage
    debain/changelog, which is much more robust than the previous construction
added:
  - a new RKWard plugin allows you to really quickly get started with your
    own roxyPackage script
  - basic support for "cph" (copyright holder) field in author roles

changes in version 0.04-1 (2014-06-14)
fixed:
  - tools::buildVignettes() doesn't produce PDFs if they are already present;
    remove present PDFs, if the "doc" action is active. the vignettes
    creation was reworked to deal with vignettes directories more smoothly, e.g.
    create inst/doc and copy results and sources there
  - debianize() didn't auto-append default dependencies correctly
  - docs of debianize() falsely still said that source packaging wasn't
    implemented
  - example in debianize() showed description in lowercase, which wouldn't
    work
  - debianize() didn't get multiple authors quite all right
  - the copyright file generated by debianize() missed out the homepage and
    overwrite rule
  - signature changes to roxygenize() in roxygen2 >= 4.0.0 are now implemented
  - the logic to remove build directories for debian packages could have
    dangerous consequences if you chose them unwise; now, the directory will only
    be removed if it was empty before the build process
changed:
  - debianize() gained the new argument "repo.name", used for generating a
    debian package from the OpenPGP key used for secure apt. you should set this
    to something different from the default if you plan to actually publish
    the repository -- if you don't, you'll get a warning
  - expect gpg2 as the default (earlier versions defaulted to gpg)
  - moved code for generation of several debian package files into autonomous
    internal functions
  - suppressed the LaTeX output, so the console messages are more
    comprehensible
  - in the sources, moved definition of classes and methods to files with
    more speaking names
  - removed the temporary hack to test roxygen3, since roxygen2 4.x is
    already released and runs out-of-the-box with this version of roxyPackage
  - source packages for debian now default to xz compression
added:
  - new function debianizeKeyring() can generate debian packages from OpenPGP
    keys
  - new argument "compression" for debianize()

changes in version 0.03-12 (2014-03-15)
fixed:
  - tools::pkgVignettes() and tools::buildVignettes() stopped working without
    an existing DESCRIPTION file. working around that by moving the calls to
    a place where the file should be present already
  - added a workaround for roxygen2 >= 3.0.0, calling
    roxygen2:::source_package() to overcome unsolved issues with its S4 implementation
changed:
  - managed to remove some of the setwd() calls, but some don't seem to be
    replaceable as of now. this seems to trigger the problems with the unit
    tests, so they remain deactivated in tests/ test_roxyPackage_package.R, but
    have been revived in inst/tests/test,R
  - added a proper GPL notice at the beginning of each R file
  - replaced all tabs in the source code by two space characters

changes in version 0.03-11 (2013-10-27)
fixed:
  - another attempt to fix the .find.package() issue (see log for 0.03-5), as
    suggested by kurt hornik
  - typo in docs to debianize() corrected ("epoch" instead of "Epoch")
  - dep4deb() now always returns $dl as a matrix
  - "--no-vignettes" is deprecated as of R 3.0.0, replaced with
    "--no-build-vignettes"
  - corrected some ::: operators into ::
  - new action "cleanRd" checks for lines longer than 90 chars in Rd files
    and adds automatic line breaks (with a warning). otherwise R CMD check would
    complain and the package wouldn't be accepted on CRAN. this is actually a
    workaround for a bug in roxygen2, regarding automatically generated usage
    sections
  - in the generated DESCRIPTION file, authors and contributors will no
    longer be listed with their e-mail address, just plain names
  - sandboxing and running the "check" action now also copies suggested
    packages to the sandbox folders if neccessary
removed:
  - removed the unit tests for this release, because they suddenly stopped
    working with "R CMD check" (while still running fine from an R session).
    i.e., it's not that the tests themselves fail, but the testthat package stops
    with yet mysterious errors. i filed a report, hope this can be solved
    soon: https://github.com/hadley/testthat/issues/86
changed:
  - the vignette was moved from inst/doc to inst/vignettes
  - some lines in the docs were too long and have been shortened
  - internal function autoLineBreak() returns a nameless character vector now
  - beginning with this version, roxyPackage is no longer hosted on CRAN. its
    policies and checks have become more strict over time, and since the
    alternative would have been to reduce this package's features to remain in
    full compliance, i decided to have the package removed instead. the problem
    is this: the NEWS.Rd related features rely on calls to the internal
    function tools:::news2Rd(), as is even recommended in the manual to news(); CRAN
    doesn't allow this use of an internal functions, even if it's exactly what
    the R docs say.
added:
  - another EXPERIMENTAL feature: call
    'roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name="Rdevel", value=TRUE)' and 'roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name="Rversion",
    value="x.y.z")' to manually set an arbitrary R version string to be able to build
    against bleeding edge R-devel installations
  - new roxy.package() arguments "Rbuildignore" and "Rinstignore" can be used
    to control .Rbuildignore and .Rinstignore files, respectively

changes in version 0.03-10 (2013-06-11)
added:
  - debianize(): support for epoch in debian package versioning
  - debianize(): support for appending package dependencies rather than
    replacing the automatically found
  - debianize(): support for arbitrary fields in "deb.description"
fixed:
  - the *-package.R file used to contain an alias of the package name alone,
    which would cause trouble if there's a function or similar by the same
    name/alias. now only the alias '<package name>-package' will be included.

changes in version 0.03-9 (2013-05-10)
fixed:
  - internal function dateRFC2822() now always forces LC_TIME into locale "C"
    temporarily, instead of trying to use "en_GB.UTF-8" (which is not
    available on all machines). this small function is needed for timestamps in
    Debian changelogs
  - fixed the split-up of debinaizing actions for multiple R installations:
    the previous implementation accidently dropped package building completely
added:
  - new function dep4deb() can recursively download dependencies for a given
    package. this is still in its early stages and probably buggy, and i am
    also considering placing all Debian related functionality into a package of
    its own (which would become a dependency of roxyPackage), soon.

changes in version 0.03-8 (2013-05-07)
fixed:
  - due to a silly bug, debianize() usually ignored the fields "Homepage" and
    "Essential" for the control file
added:
  - debianize() can now try to build a valid debian package directly from
    arbitrary package sources; it will try to generate plausible dependencies
    from the R package names provided in DESCRIPTION
  - debianize() does also try to include package "Suggests" automagically
  - added some basic unit tests, using the testthat package
changed:
  - the default "origin" value of debianize() has been changed from "other"
    to "other-roxypackage"
  - debianize() now adds dependecies to r-base-core (instead of r-base) and
    debhelper >= 7.0.0 (instead of >= 4.1.0) if none are given
  - debianize() doesn't set the maintainer of upstream as the debian package
    maintainer by default any longer, but generates a maintainer ID from
    system information and throws a warning. this should encourage everyone to set
    at least valid maintainer information manually
  - if multiple R installations are provided, the "deb" action will be split
    up: debianizing the sources will be done during first run, but package
    building during the last

changes in version 0.03-7 (2013-04-16)
fixed:
  - OS X binary packages for R >= 3.0.0 will now be stored in
    $REPOSITORY/bin/macosx/contrib, and no longer in $REPOSITORY/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib

changes in version 0.03-6 (2013-04-07)
added:
  - debianize() now supports both strict package names according to the
    Debain R Policy as well as package names with a dot, whichever is expected by
    your r-cran.mk file. Ignoring the policy is the default, as that is the
    de-facto standard.

changes in version 0.03-5 (2013-03-30)
fixed:
  - .find.package() will soon be removed from R, replaced it with
    find.package() for R >= 2.13

changes in version 0.03-4 (2013-03-12)
changed:
  - internally replaced paste(..., sep="") with paste0(...), and added a
    version dependent wrapper for compatibility with R < 2.15
added:
  - AGPL and Artistic License 2.0 have been added to the common licenses
fixed:
  - license files are now called LICENSE.txt; this is to prevent their
    installation, as suggested by 'Writing R Extensions'

changes in version 0.03-3 (2013-02-13)
added:
  - extended sandboxing possibilities to archive.packages() and debianize()
changed:
  - sandbox() will now remove all paths set if "active" is FALSE

changes in version 0.03-2 (2013-02-11)
added:
  - new sandbox feature, see ?sandbox() and ?sandbox.status(). this needs
    testing, and future releases will get support for this in all relevant
    functions, not just roxy.package(), as it is now.

changes in version 0.03-1 (2013-01-29)
changed:
  - split documentation for ChangeLog functions and methods
added:
  - there is now an EXPERIMENTAL option to be able to toy around with
    roxygen3: call 'roxyPackage:::set.roxyEnv(name="roxygenVersion", value=3)' to
    enable some hidden features, i.e. use roxygen3::roxygenise() instead of
    roxygen2::roxygenize(). you need to install and load the roxygen3 package first
    -- temper with this at your own risk. please note: there will probably
    never be an official roxygen3 package on CRAN, and once its features were
    merged into roxygen2, this option might be patched out of roxyPackage again.
  - this is the first version of roxyPackage supposed to be released on CRAN

changes in version 0.02-23 (2013-01-25)
changed:
  - updated vignette
fixed:
  - debian installation notes will not be linked from a package's HTML page
    if there is no built debian package in the repository

changes in version 0.02-22 (2012-10-30)
changed:
  - the title for *-package.R files now states "The <package name> Package"
    instead of the Title: entry from the description
fixed:
  - order of ChangeLog entries is now checked, so that the newest entries get
    on top

changes in version 0.02-21 (2012-10-14)
added:
  - new action "log" generates an initial ChangeLog, if none is found
  - introducing new functions initChangeLog(), readChangeLog(),
    writeChangeLog(), as well as the methods getChangeLogEntry() and updateChangeLog().
    they are probably not bug-free, but should ease the management of proper R
    ChangeLogs considerably.
changed:
  - this ChangeLog was read-in by readChangeLog(), updated with the log
    entries for this release by updateChangeLog(), and written back with
    writeChangeLog().

changes in version 0.02-20 (2012-09-29)
fixed:
  - contributors in Author@R/Authors@R fields are now also added to
    *-package.R and DESCRIPTION
  - the "check" option "--as-cran" is automatically stripped for R < 2.15

changes in version 0.02-19 (2012-09-09)
changed:
  - the "check" action now has "--as-cran" set as the default option
added:
  - the "doc" action now also supports "vignette" subdirectories in addition
    to "inst/doc" for vignette files
  - added new function archive.packages() to move old versions of packages to
    an archive directory, or to remove them for good. since this is
    potentially dangerous and needs some rounds of testing, its "reallyDoIt"-option
    needs to be set to TRUE manually, otherwise a dry run is done, i.e., all
    actions are only printed and not done, so you can check the outcome first.

changes in version 0.02-18 (2012-07-30)
fixed:
  - using shortPathName() to fix problems on windows caused by the path
    normalization introduced with 0.02-17 (thanks to henrik singmann for tracking
    this one down)
changed:
  - wrote some new internal helper functions, namely createMissingDir() and
    removeIfExists(), and replaced their manual pendants in the roxy.package()
    code, which is now easier to read

changes in version 0.02-17 (2012-07-20)
fixed:
  - the tar option "--exclude-vcs" is not always implemented, especially not
    in the BSD tar of Mac OS X; so excluding version control directories is
    now done in a more manual manner in roxyPackage
  - also, on Mac OS X the tar binary is now identified using Sys.which("tar")
  - finally, "--exclude=*~" caused trouble if path names contained a tilde
    for $HOME, so this was replaced with a more reliable way to exclude backup~
    files as well
  - all root paths are now normalized before first use, especially to perform
    tilde expansion, because this lead to errors with tar()

changes in version 0.02-16 (2012-07-12)
fixed:
  - HTML generation now also works if there's no "Author:" field in the
    DESCRIPTION

changes in version 0.02-15 (2012-06-10)
changed:
  - the data.frame with the package description doesn't need to have entries
    for "Author" or "Maintainer" any more, as long as "Authors@R" is present

changes in version 0.02-14 (2012-06-05)
fixed:
  - roxyPackage now supports multiple vignette files in one package
  - fixed problems if the repository isn't on the same file system as the
    sources

changes in version 0.02-13 (2012-05-12)
fixed:
  - fixed malformed BibTeX entry in CITATION if more than one author given

changes in version 0.02-12 (2012-05-11)
fixed:
  - line breaks were missing in repo HTML, which lead to malformed <pre>
    sections
  - debian repo information will now generally be prepared for binary and
    source packages

changes in version 0.02-11 (2012-04-29)
added:
  - added a vignette
  - debianize() now creates debian/compat, by default set to level 7
changed:
  - status messages are more consistent now
  - the link to a debian binary package moved from the general package HTML
    page to the debian repository info page

changes in version 0.02-10 (2012-04-19)
added:
  - debianize() now checks if a given GnuPG key is already available as a
    file in the repository, and if not, saves is as <key ID>.asc
  - the "html" action now also adds auto-generated information on how to
    install debian packages from the maintained repository

changes in version 0.02-9 (2012-04-15)
added:
  - this is the first package, along with its dependecies, which is also
    available as a debian package build with roxyPackage
changed:
  - if information is to be fetched from a DESCRIPTION file and there is no
    "Date" field, roxy.package() considers "Packaged" and then
    "Date/Publication" as fallback alternatives (and throws a warning)
  - the actions "deb", "roxy", "cite", "license", "doc", "cl2news" and
    "news2rss" are now only run once for builds against multiple R installations,
    because their outcome should be the same anyway
fixed:
  - 'deb.options' are now also passed to recursive calls of roxy.package(),
    although there's still no solution for actual builds against multiple R
    installations

changes in version 0.02-8 (2012-04-14)
added:
  - roxy.package() now checks for needed fields in DESCRIPTION, if that file
    is used to get info on the package, and throws an error if something is
    missing
  - installation now includes common-licenses.zip
  - roxy.package() has a new action "license" to detect the package license
    and save a copy of common free software licenses as the package's LICENSE
    file
changed:
  - added hints on dependencies to the debianize() docs
fixed:
  - regex to get author info without e-mail address for debian/copyright now
    works with multiple authors
  - fixed some formatting issues with debian/copyright

changes in version 0.02-7 (2012-04-11)
added:
  - debianize() can now sign Release files with GnuPG
  - roxy.package() has a new action "deb" and a new parameter 'deb.options',
    to invoke debianize() directly
  - debian packages are now added to the html index files
changed:
  - Release files in debianize() are now generated with apt-ftparchive
  - debianize() talks a little more about what it's busy with
  - debian package dependencies now detect R version for "r-base" and
    "r-base-dev"
fixed:
  - debian package dependencies now default to "r-base" instead of
    "r-base-dev"

changes in version 0.02-6 (2012-04-10)
added:
  - initial (and rather experimental...) support for debianizing packages
    with the debianize() function
changed:
  - internal function dateRFC2822() now does the date conversion for
    news2rss()

changes in version 0.02-5 (2012-04-07)
added:
  - generated index.html pages now have a generator meta tag, like the RSS
    feeds
fixed:
  - removed initial tabulator in BibTeX entries of generated citation.html

changes in version 0.02-4 (2012-04-06)
fixed:
  - zip() should now *really* ignore backup files (ending with a tilde)
changed:
  - 'cleanup=TRUE' now recursively removes backup files in the source
    directory

changes in version 0.02-3 (2012-04-05)
  - using Rd2pdf instead of Rd2dvi for R >= 2.15 now; in 'Rcmd.options',
    Rd2dvi will still be recognized, though
  - zip() should now ignore backup files (ending with a tilde)

changes in version 0.02-2 (2012-03-18)
  - RSS feeds in HTML header now also state the package name (action "html")
  - re-wrote HTML genrating functions, now all is done use XiMpLe methods

changes in version 0.02-1 (2012-03-14)
  - added new function news2rss() to write RSS feeds (XML) from
    NEWS.Rd/NEWS.html files
  - action "html" now adds the RSS feed for a package to the HTML header and
    news link
  - exported a new function, cl2news(), which now carries out the action by
    the same name, but can also used stand-alone
  - added dependency to the XiMpLe package to make the handling of all
    HTML/XML stuff easier
  - removed "target" attributes from HTML anchors to comply with XHTML 1.0
    strict

changes in version 0.01-20 (2012-03-11)

  - added option to manually specify options to the internal R CMD calls to
    roxy.package()
  - fixed build for multiple R homes, now using R CMD INSTALL instead of
    install.packages()
  - OS is now checked and on Windows shell() is used instead of system()
  - fixed broken "check" action on Windows
  - added action "cl2news" to transform ChangeLogs into NEWS.Rd
  - action "html" now transforms inst/NEWS.Rd into NEWS.html and links this
    in index.html, if found
  - replaced unicode symbols in entities() with \uxxxx ASCII escapes

changes in version 0.01-18 (2012-02-09)
  - removed null function roxygen() from package description files, NULL
    alone is sufficient in roxygen2
