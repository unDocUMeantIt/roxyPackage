Description: GNU R package "Utilities to Automate Package Builds"
 .
 The intention of this package is to make packaging R code as easy as possible.
 'roxyPackage' uses tools from the 'roxygen2' package to generate
 documentation. It also automatically generates and updates files like
 *-package.R, DESCRIPTION, CITATION, ChangeLog and NEWS.Rd. Building packages
 supports source format, as well as several binary formats (MS Windows, Mac OS
 X, Debian GNU/Linux) if the package contains pure R code only. The packages
 built are stored in a fully functional local R package repository which can be
 synced to a web server to share them with others. This includes the generation
 of browsable HTML pages similar to CRAN, with support for RSS feeds from the
 ChangeLog. Please read the vignette for a more detailed explanation by
 example.
